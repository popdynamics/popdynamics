# Popdynamics

Popdynamics is a library for building epidemiological models. Popdynamics is designed to make it easy to build, and modify compartment models. As well, it provides options to switch between deterministic ODE solutions, and stochastic discrete-time and continuous-time models.

# Why?

- epidemiological models
  - most frequently consist of systems of differential equations
  - equations describe relationships between compartments
  - strict conservation of populations
- typical epidemiological modelling
  - inspired by fortran
  - today implemented in `matlab`, `python` or `R` 
  - implemented as differential equations
  - reliance on algebraic symbols
  - focus on the differential equation
- increasing trend to more complex models
  - to simulate realistic dynamics, modern models may need stratification by:
    - compartment (as patient progresses through infection, activation, detection, treatment, recovery, death, etc.)
    - manifestation (organ involved, infectiousness)
    - drug resistance of infecting organism
    - population/demographic risk group
    - medical comorbidity
    - age
    - others
  - stratifications are often multiplicative, meaning that realistic models may require hundreds to thousands of compartments or more
  - it then becomes difficult to impossible to track and understand the behaviour of every compartment individuals
  - also difficulty/impossible to write down the system of ODEs and more prone to mistakes

# Modern programming approach

Basepop provides a modern approach to epidemiological modelling. It incorporates a style of programming from various areas of programming. The essence of the approach is to modularize the different parts of the modelling so that the essential complexity is maintained, and accidental complexity is sidelined. This allows the focus on the epidemiology and not the maths, or the syntax

The other aspect is to ensure the data-structures of the model are fully exposed and can be manipulated easily for higher order analysis.

It's important to create a suitable abstraction so that the focus at different parts of the programming is on one thing. This allows clearer thinking about the model, and also helps with bugs. If different parts of the program are only concerned with one element of the model, then finding and detecting bugs will be considerably easier.

The Pythonic approach is about using the correct idioms in Python. Using as much of the syntax in Python to reduce clutter, needless variables, and control structures. Of cousre, it takes awhile to master this as Python provides many more types of programming approachs than Fortran or Matlab: first class functions, functional program, introspection, dynamic programming.

- `Pythonic` approach
- the goal
  - focus on the epidemiology 
  - hide the maths
- alternative view
  - not equation based
  - focus on compartments
  - focus on flows
  - because we have constructed with flows then the flowchar can be built using the `grapgviz` library
- by intelligently splitting things up, allows:
  - creating automatic flow diagrams for debugging
  - allows constructing equations behind the scenes
  - thus freeing the researcher from general house-keeping and focusing on the model

  - dynamically create compartments
  - build up model through identify flows, 
  - let's the model build the vector representation and differentiation and derivatives
  - use strings to identify compartments and parameters
  - transfers between compartments built up using edges defined by the labels
  - auto generation of graphs of models
  - allows programmatic generation of compartments and transfers
  - allows easy scale-up functions
  - avoidance of errors, such as:
    - transition flows that do not have either an entry or an exit compartment,
        or the entry value is not equal to the exit
    - entry (birth) flows that do not have an entry compartment or have an exit compartment
    - exit (death) flows that have an entry compartment or do not have an exit compartment
    - fixed flows that are not associated with a constant parameter or variable flows that are not associated with a
        time-variant parameter to be calculated at each model step
- by ensuring methods and functions are as independent as possible, adaptations to model can usually be achieved through
    changes to a single method/function
    - for example, further integration methods can be added to explicit and scipy by changing a single method only
    - similarly, additional output diagnostics can be added by changing a single method
        - e.g. those specific to a particular organism/disease

# General sequential approach

- setting up compartments
- defining flows between compartments
- setting up parameters
- setting up dynamic transmissions
- collecting diagnostic variables
- saving trajectories

# Examples

- create a model with dynamic transmission
- show how to extract out vectors and derivatives
- programmatically generate compartments 
- programmatically generate diagnostic variables
- saving variables for use later
- create a simple model @done
- scale-up function @done
- flow chart @done
- produce graphs with matplotlib - javascript option @done

# Requirements

- python 2.7
- numpy
- scipy 
- graphviz.py 
- graphviz binary on path: http://www.graphviz.org/
